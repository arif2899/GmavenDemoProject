# GmavenDemoProject
# Automated Email System

The goal of the project was to minimise outdated data in our system as much as possible. 
I have implemented an automated email system that is triggered on the requirements stated below.
 
**Requirements**
We follow up with the funds and managers under 5 different scenarios, for each of these scenarios we have an email template: 
* Received last month, not this month
* Last received 3 months ago
* Last received < 1 year ago
* Last received > 1 year ago
* Combination of 4 scenarios at the top

To run the code you need to open the code file ( .pynb)  using google colab and upload the dataset ( .csv ) into google sheets.
